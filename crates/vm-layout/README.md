# üß© Swamp VM Layout

## Overview

This crate is responsible for mapping high-level Swamp language types to their
low-level memory representations in the Swamp Virtual Machine. It serves as a
crucial bridge between the abstract type system defined in `swamp-types` and the
concrete memory layouts needed by the VM at runtime.

## Purpose

The `swamp-vm-layout` crate:

- Computes memory layouts for all Swamp types, determining their size,
  alignment, and field offsets

- Handles type lowering by mapping high-level types to their concrete memory
  representations

- Manages memory layout deduplication for structurally identical types

- Ensures proper alignment and memory padding according to C ABI
  requirements (special handling for zero size structs)

## Key Components

### `LayoutCache`

The core structure that manages type layout information with two primary caches:

- `id_to_layout`: Maps `TypeId` to `BasicTypeRef`, containing one entry per
  unique TypeId

- `kind_to_layout`: Maps `TypeKind` to `BasicTypeRef`, enabling sharing layouts
  between structurally identical types

### Layout Functions

The crate provides specialized layout functions for different type categories:

- Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, strings)
- Composite types (structs, tuples)
- Sum types (enums, optional types)
- Collection types (vectors, maps, grids)
- Collection views

## Usage

This crate is primarily intended for use within the Swamp compiler toolchain and
VM implementation, usually not for direct use by Swamp language users.

```toml
[dependencies]
swamp-vm-layout = "0.2.14"
```
