# Swamp Programming Language üêä

> A magical language that lives in the swamp.

Swamp is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed for writing reliable and maintainable code. It combines functional programming concepts with pragmatic design choices to create an expressive and safe development experience.

## üåü Features

* **Strong Static Typing:** Catch errors at compile time with a powerful type system and type inference.
* **Pattern Matching** - Express complex control flow clearly and safely
* **Immutability by Default:** Reduce bugs with controlled mutability when needed.
* **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs):** Express data structures naturally with `enum` (sum types) and `struct` (product types).
* **Module System:** Organize code into reusable modules with explicit imports/exports.
* **Zero-Cost Abstractions** - High-level features with minimal runtime overhead
* **Friendly Error Messages:** Clear guidance when things go wrong, with source context.
