# Swamp Test Runner üß™

> Your trusty companion for testing Swamp code! üêä Ensure your swamp magic works as expected.

Swamp Test Runner is the official test runner and framework for the
[Swamp Programming Language](https://swamp-lang.org/), designed to make testing your Swamp projects
simple, expressive,
and reliable. Write tests with the same clarity and power that Swamp offers for your main code.

## ü§î Why Swamp Test Runner?

The test runner aims to provide:

* **Seamless Integration:** Designed especially for Swamp, leveraging its type system and
  features.
* **Clear Syntax:** Write tests that are easy to read and understand.
* **Expressive Assertions:** Powerful and intuitive ways to check your code's behavior.
* **Helpful Output:** Quickly pinpoint failures with informative messages (and yes, cool Unicode for
  pass/fail ‚úÖ‚ùå!).

## ‚ú® Features

* **Simple Test Definition:** Use the `#[test]` annotation to mark your test functions. The test
  function can not take any parameters.
* **Assertion:** Use `assert()` in the tests, or `panic()`.
* **Automatic Test Discovery:** Finds your tests without complex configuration.
* **Detailed Failure Reports:** Understand what went wrong and where, leveraging Swamp's friendly
  error style.
* **Clean & Readable Output:** Know at a glance how your test suite is doing.
