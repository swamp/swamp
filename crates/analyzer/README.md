# Swamp Analyzer

Performs semantic analysis for the [Swamp programming language](https://github.com/swamp/swamp).

## Overview

This crate bridges the gap between parsing and code generation/interpretation. It takes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by `swamp-parser` (using types from `swamp-ast`) and transforms it into a type-checked, resolved Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) defined in `swamp-semantic`.

The core process involves:

*   **Type Checking:** Verifying that operations, assignments, function calls, etc., adhere to the Swamp type system rules.
*   **Name Resolution:** Linking identifiers (variables, functions, types) to their definitions within the correct scope.
*   **Semantic Validation:** Performing other checks like correct function arity, operator usage, and pattern matching exhaustiveness (potentially).
*   **ASG Construction:** Building the `swamp_semantic::Expression` tree, which represents the program with full type information and resolved references.
